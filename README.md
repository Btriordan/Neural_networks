# Neural_networks
In the neural network model, I treid to mimic the rule of having 2-3 times the neurons compared to the features.  We had 48 features so I used 150 neurons.  At first I tried to use one hidden layer of 150 neurons, but I made three hidden layers each with 50 neurons whihc performed slightly better.  
I was not able to get to the target model performance.  I hit an accuracy score of 74.1%.  In order to increase the model performance, I binned all classifications and application types that had below 100 unique values and binned them into "other" categories.  After not hitting the score I wanted, I increased the classifications to all classes with below 200 unique values and all applications with below 20 unique values.  This improved the accuracy score. I also tried different applications, such as "ragu" but "sigmoid" worked the best.  
I would implement the random forest test because with such a large dataset, the SVM model would take to much time and storage.
